    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #2c3e50;">Purpose</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #555;">
        This system is designed to manage and organize yoga therapy practices based on evidence from research papers and clinical studies. 
        It enables researchers and practitioners to create structured therapy modules for various diseases and conditions, 
        track supporting evidence through Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), and generate personalized practice recommendations 
        based on scientific data.

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #2c3e50;">System Logic & How It Works</h3>
    
    <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
        <h4 style="color: #495057; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">1. Module-Based Structure</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
            The system is organized around <strong>Modules</strong>, where each module represents a research paper or study 
            that focuses on yoga therapy for a specific disease. A single disease can have multiple modules, as different 
            research papers may propose different sets of practices for the same condition.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #555;">
            For example, <em>Depression</em> may have Module A (developed by Naveen et al., 2013) with one set of practices, 
            and Module B (developed by another research team) with a different set of practices. Each module is linked to 
            its source research paper through a hyperlink.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
        <h4 style="color: #495057; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">2. Practices Within Modules</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #555;">
            Each module contains multiple <strong>Yoga Practices</strong> organized across nine practice segments: 
            Preparatory Practice, Breathing Practice, Suryanamaskara, Yogasana, Pranayama, Meditation, 
            Additional Practices, Kriya (Cleansing Techniques), and Yogic Counselling. Practices are automatically 
            associated with the disease that the module addresses.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
        <h4 style="color: #495057; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">3. RCT Database & Evidence Scoring</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
            The system maintains a comprehensive <strong>RCT (Randomized Controlled Trial) Database</strong> that tracks 
            clinical studies and research papers supporting specific practice-disease combinations. Each RCT entry includes 
            detailed information about the study, participants, interventions, and results.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #555;">
            <strong>RCT Score:</strong> The system calculates an RCT count for each practice within a disease context. 
            The higher the RCT score (number of supporting research studies), the stronger the evidence for that practice 
            in treating that particular disease. This scoring mechanism helps prioritize practices with stronger scientific 
            backing when generating recommendations.

        <h4 style="color: #495057; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">4. Recommendation Generation</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #555;">
            When generating therapy recommendations, the system combines practices from relevant modules, removes duplicates, 
            applies contraindications based on disease combinations, and prioritizes practices with higher RCT scores. 
            This ensures that recommendations are evidence-based, safe, and personalized to the specific disease profile.
