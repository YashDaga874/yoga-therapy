<h2>Evidence-Based Personalised Yoga Therapy Module Prescription System</h2>
<p style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #667eea; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
    The Evidence-Based Personalised Yoga Therapy System refers to a rule-based clinical decision-support system that prescribes structured, standardised, and personalised yoga therapy modules grounded in empirical evidence, expert validation, and organised in accordance with the Integrated Yoga Therapy (IAYT) framework.

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #555;">
        Although evidence for yoga-based interventions is increasing, Yoga consultants often rely on individual experience and subjective judgement when selecting practices, leading to variability, inconsistency, and challenges in managing complex or multiple health conditions. This system is intended to support yoga therapy consulatants by providing a structured yet flexible approach to module selection that preserves individualisation while ensuring consistency, safety, and alignment with available evidence. By organising therapeutic recommendations within an integrated yogic framework, the system seeks to make evidence-informed yoga therapy more transparent, reproducible, and practically usable, without constraining professional judgement or reducing the holistic nature of yoga therapy.

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #2c3e50;">System Logic & How It Works</h3>
    
    <div>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
            The system begins with a set of yoga practices that have already been carefully selected using research evidence and expert agreement. Each practice is clearly defined, linked to specific health conditions, and checked for safety. When a yoga therapist enters an individual’s main health concern along with any additional conditions, the system first considers how important each condition is relative to the others. This helps the system decide where more emphasis is needed.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
            The system then looks at all relevant yoga practices and removes anything that may be unsafe for any of the selected conditions. Among the remaining practices, those with stronger research support and greater expert agreement are given higher priority. Based on this prioritisation, the system selects and organises a set of practices in a balanced way, ensuring that no single condition dominates unfairly unless clinically required.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #555;">
            Finally, the selected practices are arranged into a coherent yoga therapy module that reflects an integrated understanding of the body, breath, mind, and lifestyle. The result is a yoga therapy module that follows a consistent structure, adapts to individual needs, and remains grounded in evidence and professional judgment.
